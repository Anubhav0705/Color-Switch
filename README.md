# Color-Switch Game

# Project Description
In this project we created a JavaFX application for the game ColorSwitch. The objective of the game is to collect as many stars as possible
by manoeuvring the obstacles. If you hit any obstacle, you can continuewith your earned stars or the game ends and you have to start from the
beginning. This is a high score game. We have implemented the infinity
game mode of the classic gameplay.The player has to use a single input
(the up key of keyboard) to keep the ball afloat as well as move upward.
A constant amount of distance is travelled each time the input is
given.The ball will fall if no input is given, as if it is moving against
gravity. The player has to collect the “Stars” placed along the gameplay.
Moreover , we have also used color switches to change the ball color
and make the game interesting.
